   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys:
     ```
     POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_key
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
     PORT=8080
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the server directory and install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

5. **Start the Server**:

+------------------+          +------------------+
|                  |          |                  |
|     Client       | <------> |      Server      |

- The client interacts with the server through API calls to resolve tickers, fetch stock data, and generate reports.
- The server handles requests, communicates with the Polygon API and OpenAI, and returns the results to the client.
